Canvas is a project to simplify iOS development for both designers and developers.
It had been difficult for designers to get hands on building the product with the lack of objective-c and Xcode experience, and a hard time for developer to use reasonable amount of time and lines of code just to achieve really simple effects.

With Canvas, creating stunning animations requires zero lines of code, trendy effects like the Parallax headers, Sticky sections, Blurred Backgrounds, will be as simple as few lines of code changes.

Demo App
========

![](http://f.cl.ly/items/350X372e2i1x2y2A1h0K/canvas-animation.gif)

The demo app in this project uses [CocoaPods][], please run `pod install` after you download this project, then open `Canvas.xcworkspace`. 

See this screencast in action:

Unable to build demo?
-----

If you're getting some errors like **Accelerate.framework not include**, please update your CocoaPods version:

    $ [sudo] gem install cocoapods


We also have a live demo available at [homepage][].



Getting Started
===============

If you're already on CocoaPods, installing our library is easy:

    $ edit Podfile
    platform :ios, '7.0'
    pod 'Canvas', '~> 0.1.2'

Make sure you also update the dependencies by running this command afterwards:

    pod install

Then you should now have the Xcode workspace (`.xcworkspace`) ready.

    $open App.xcworkspace
    
That's it and you are good to go! See our [blog posts][homepage] for hands on tutorial.


How to Use
==========

Using Interface Builder (no code required)
----

![](http://f.cl.ly/items/0q0H031a023Y243k3F1O/img-animation@2x.png)

Specify the class `CSAnimationView`, and configurate the runtime attributes `duration`, `delay`, and `type`.

Please also get started with our more [detailed explanation][tutorial] on what Canvas can do.

Using Code
----------

It's very similar to using Interface Builder, instead you just setup the custom view in code.

```objective-c
#import "Canvas.h"
```

```objective-c
CSAnimationView *animationView = [[CSAnimationView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 100)];

animationView.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];

animationView.duration = 0.5;
animationView.delay    = 0;
animationView.type     = CSAnimationTypeMorph;

[self.view addSubview:animationView];

// Add your subviews into animationView
// [animationView addSubview:<#(UIView *)#>]

// Kick start the animation immediately
[animationView startCanvasAnimation];
```

Issues
======

It has been reported that current version doesn't work very well with AutoLayout. Canvas animates view frame/position but autolayout requires manipulating constraints. I am not sure if there's any quick way without changing from the ground up. Our [discussion here](https://github.com/CanvasPod/Canvas/issues/23) has some proposed solution but seems imperfect (but it works under iOS 8 tho). Please join our conversation or make pull request if you know a better solution!
